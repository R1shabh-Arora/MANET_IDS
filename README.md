Exploring Model Complexity and Accuracy in MANET Security Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the machine learning code for my MEng Computer Science with Cyber Security project at the University of Southampton. The project investigates the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy in securing Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) using machine learning techniques.

Contents:
SVM Model: Implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for detecting and classifying network intrusions using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
Model Comparison Script: A script to compare different machine learning models on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, evaluating their accuracy and performance.
Key Highlights:
SVM Model Development: Train and optimize the SVM model to detect and classify network intrusions.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the accuracy and complexity of different models to determine the best model for the dataset.
Usage:
Clone the repository and explore the different directories for specific scripts and resources. Detailed instructions and comments are provided within each script to guide you through the processes.
